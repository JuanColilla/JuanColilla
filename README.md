## About Me

I’m an iOS Engineer based in Vila-Seca, Catalonia, with a passion for building clean, maintainable apps using modern Swift technologies. Since 2019 I’ve worked across startups and consultancies, gradually moving from junior roles to leading core features in production apps. I’m curious by nature and always eager to explore new ways to apply Swift.
